    "The goal of this project is to create a messaging app that allows it's users to send private messages to each other over the internet without worrying about their messages being read by potential attackers. This is achieved by using an encryption scheme similar to a vignere cipher, with some extra layers of security that prevent it to from being attacked by a Kasisky test. We do this by making words such as \"the\" to not be encrypted by into the same cipher text, and thus adding more security to messages in the app. We also try to make the key very hard to crack by giving each user a list of keys to use per message, thus giving another added layer of security. \n",

    "<h3>3.1.1 Encryption Algorithm Design</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Basic Functionality</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed and implemented our own encryption scheme which is built on top of the Vigenere Cipher. At the heart of the algorithm each character of the plain text is mapped to another random character according to a randomized key of fixed length. The new character is then inserted into the ciphertext and once all the characters in the plain text have been mapped and inserted into the ciphertext, the ciphertext is sent over the internet to the client. The client can then decrypt the ciphertext using the shared secret key and obtain the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Levels of Complexity</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are known methods of cracking basic Viginere ciphers, such as the Kasisky Test, it is clear that we need to begin increasing the complexity of the above algorithm. Our encryption scheme accomplishes this in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we did was increase the number of characters we can encrypt. Instead of only being able to encrypt 26 characters, like a basic Vigenere cipher, our algorithm can map 100 characters. Specifically our algorithm can map every single printable ascii character to any other printable ascii character. This significanlty increases the effectiveness of the algorithm as now spaces, tabs, newlines, numbers, and any other printable characters that could show up in the plaintext are now encrypted to some other printable character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing we did was randomize the keys. Each key is a fixed length sequence of random characters drawn from the set of printable ascii characters. The length of the keys will be set to the length of the maximum message size that we will allow for the messenger. This will make it so that for a single message the key never repeats. However an attacker intercepting multiple messages encrypted with the same key becomes a potential vulnerability. To mitigate this risk, each user has a set of keys. Each time a user sends a message the algorithm will randomely choose 1 of the keys to use for encryption. On the decryption side the client will need to decrypt the message with each key and then choose the result that isn't garbage text. To detect the non-grabage text the encryption algorithm inserts a check sum of the original plain text at the end of the encrypted message. The decrytper then extracts the check sum from the ciphertext, decrypts the ciphertext with each key, recalculates the check sum for each plain text, and returns the plain text whose check sum match the extracted check sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "The third thing we did is gave the algorithm the ability to inject random characters into the ciphertext at every other index. This adds further randomness to the ciphertext and adds another layer to the complexity of the encryption scheme. The last thing the encryption algorithm does is insert random characters from the set of printable ascii characters into the ciphertext. The first thing the decrypter does after it extracts the check sum is remove every other character as it knows that these characters are not part of the message.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Further Improvements</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "These are some of the ideas for improvments to the algorithm that we will attempt to implement.\n",
    "\n",
    "1:\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of inserting characters truly randomly, we insert characters with probabilities pulled from a probability distribution. This will give us the ability to mimic some level of language in the ciphertext. There are techniques for detecting true randomnes in the ciphertext thus by inserting characters with varying probabilities we can reduce the amount of randomness involved and make it much more difficult to detect.\n",
    "\n",
    "2:\n",
    "\n",
    "We rotate the set of keys used to encrypt the messages on a per message basis. For instance each user will have a list of 100 sets of keys. Each time a user sends a message it will use a different set of keys to encrypt. Thus in order for an attacker to obtain 2 messages encrypted with same set of keys he would need, on average, to intercept 100+ messages. \n",
