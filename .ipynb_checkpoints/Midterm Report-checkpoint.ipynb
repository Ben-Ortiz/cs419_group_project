    "<h3>3.1.1 Encryption Algorithm Design</h3>\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Basic Functionality</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "We designed and implemented our own encryption scheme which is built on top of the Vigenere Cipher. At the heart of the algorithm each character of the plain text is mapped to another random character according to a randomized key of fixed length. The new character is then inserted into the ciphertext and once all the characters in the plain text have been mapped and inserted into the ciphertext, the ciphertext is sent over the internet to the client. The client can then decrypt the ciphertext using the shared secret key and obtain the plaintext.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h4>Levels of Complexity</h4>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because there are known methods of cracking basic Viginere ciphers, such as the Kasisky Test, it is clear that we need to begin increasing the complexity of the above algorithm. Our encryption scheme accomplishes this in a variety of ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing we did was increase the number of characters we can encrypt. Instead of only being able to encrypt 26 characters, like a basic Vigenere cipher, our algorithm can map 100 characters. Specifically our algorithm can map every single printable ascii character to any other printable ascii character. This significanlty increases the effectiveness of the algorithm as now spaces, tabs, newlines, numbers, and any other printable characters that could show up in the plaintext are now encrypted to some other printable character.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second thing we did was randomize the keys. Each key is a fixed length sequence of random characters drawn from the set of printable ascii characters. The length of the keys will be set to the length of the maximum message size that we will allow for the messenger. This will make it so that for a single message the key never repeats. However an attacker intercepting multiple messages encrypted with the same key becomes a potential vulnerability. To mitigate this risk, each user has a set of keys. Each time a user sends a message the algorithm will randomely choose 1 of the keys to use for encryption. On the decryption side the client will need to decrypt the message with each key and then choose the result that isn't garbage text. To detect the non-grabage text the encryption algorithm inserts a check sum of the original plain text at the end of the encrypted message. The decrytper then extracts the check sum from the ciphertext, decrypts the ciphertext with each key, recalculates the check sum for each plain text, and returns the plain text whose check sum match the extracted check sum.\n"
